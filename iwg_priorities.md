# Priorities of the infrastructure working group

This document describes the priorities of the LLVM infrastructure working group
(IWG). The intention of the document is to help the IWG prioritize their
work and help working group members align on goals.

Priorities of the working group, sorted from high to low:

1. Ensure stable operations of existing LLVM development infrastructure and
   developer workflows ("keeping the lights on"). That includes understanding
   urgent operations issues and ensuring they get fixed.

2. Agreeing and monitoring service level objectives (SLO) of our
   development infrastructure.

3. Driving improvements of services and workflows the keep causing issues
   (crashes, bad performance, security, high maintenance effort, high cost, ...)
   based on community feedback and service monitoring. This includes finding
   community members or hiring contractors to implement these improvements.

4. Help the community come to decisions around workflows and development, and
   help getting these implemented. This includes
   - updating the documentation on workflows and infrastructure to reflect
     the status quo and the latest decisions,
   - active involvement in the decision processes,
   - and understanding community pain points and discussing improvements.
